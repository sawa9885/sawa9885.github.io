title: Lab Reports
subtitle: Collection of my Lab reports
---
Here is a collection of the Lab reports that are assigned. We have around 30 labs in the class, where we explore various qualities and traits of PCB Design and Manufacturing. Only a handful of the reports are actually assigned as assignments. This is usually because they are 
very important or big labs. I would like to make a report for each lab, however, I do not have time to do so. Currently, this semester (Fall 2023), I TA two classes, taking up ~20 hours a week. :)

### Lab 2
Lab 2 had us build a prototype circuit with a solderless breadboard.

### Lab 5
In lab 5 we investigate the behavior of a simple slammer circuit, which draws a large current and creates noise on the power rail.

### Lab 9
In lab 9 we explored the impact of different interconnect approaches on cross-talk between
an aggressor and victim signal-return path pair.

### Lab 11-12
In labs 11 and 12 we explore the resistance of differently sized traces and find out the current carrying capability of those traces.

### Lab 15
In lab 15 we explored the professor's design of board 2, which explored good and bad PCB layouts' effect on noise and signal integrity.

### Lab 16
In lab 16 we explored single and differential-ended measurements.

### Lab 18
In lab 18 we measured inrush current and the effect it has on a circuit.

### Lab 22
In lab 22 we made a SSB version of Board 4.
