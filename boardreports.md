subtitle: Collection of my Board reports

Here is a collection of the 4 board reports from my PCB Design and Manufacturing class. Only one board has been fully built, tested and analyzed, so only one report is up. You can refer to the Lab Reports to see what we are learning about in the class.

### Board 1
This board was a simple 555 timer board. The purpose was to familiarise students with Altium Designer, and assembling SMD components.

### Board 2
This board was 555 tiner hooked to two hex inverter layouts. The purpose was to show how the layout of components will affect noise.

### Board 3
Board 3 is an Arduino Uno. We design our own 2-layer board using best practices. The goal is to reduce noise and emi when compared to the standard Arduino Uno Rev1

### Board 4
Board 4 was a shield for our Arduino uno. The shield measured thevenin voltage and resistance of a VRM.
